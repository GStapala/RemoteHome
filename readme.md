### Stuff to add :

* Main icon for application.
* Ability to add and remove lights/rooms etc.
* Create a path from options.
			Example : On WashMachine page when we click power switch, the current program dropdown apears, then after we choose the program, next controll apears and so on. (Currently they are all shown at start with IsActive property)
* Custom Picker - create a custom one from label and modal window. Xamarin picker isn't working correctly as for now.
